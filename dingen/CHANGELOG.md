# Changelog

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

Dingen as a Home Assistant app. A pre-release; `:latest` points to it. The
update runs a database migration (with a backup first).

- Home Assistant: Dingen is a Home Assistant app (add-on), from the repository
  KleijnICT/dingen-app-ha-addon. It opens in the sidebar through ingress and
  signs you in with your Home Assistant user; each Home Assistant user gets an
  own account (the first one is the administrator). Options: registration on
  the direct port and the log level; the time zone comes from Home Assistant.
  Port 8080 is optional, for the installed web app, reminders and MCP. Data
  lives in the app's folder and goes into Home Assistant backups. Every release
  appears as an update in Home Assistant with its changelog.
- Settings → Account: set a password (for an account from Home Assistant) or
  change it. `POST /api/auth/password`; `/api/auth/me` reports
  `homeAssistant` and `hasPassword`.
- The web app works under a path prefix (as Home Assistant ingress serves
  it); there it does not install a service worker or offer web push.
- The Docker image starts as root only to give `/data` to the `node` user,
  then runs as `node`; existing installs are unchanged. The update runs a
  database migration (with a backup first).
- Cache headers for `sw.js`, the manifest and the hashed assets are sent
  again; they were lost.
